# CSS calc() Function Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS with a combination of percentages and other units (e.g., pixels).  The expected behavior is that the calculation should correctly subtract the pixel value from the percentage value, resulting in a precise width. However, in some browsers or specific contexts, the calculation might yield unexpected results, leading to incorrect layout.

**The Bug:**
The main issue is that the `calc()` function might not be interpreting the percentage correctly when combined with other units, causing inaccurate calculations and misaligned elements.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Browser inconsistencies:** Different browsers might have slight variations in their implementation of the `calc()` function, leading to inconsistencies.
* **Contextual factors:** The surrounding CSS rules or HTML structure could affect how the calculation is performed.
* **Unit parsing issues:**  A rare, but potential problem could be related to the way the browser parses the units used within `calc()`.

**Solution:**
The solution involves thorough testing across various browsers and careful examination of the surrounding CSS and HTML. Alternative approaches might involve using different techniques to achieve the desired layout, such as media queries or JavaScript calculations.  This repository provides both the buggy code and a potential solution (using a media query workaround in this instance, though other solutions may exist).
